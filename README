For this assignment, we created an Interface first for our views. From there, we created 3 different
view classes to implement the IView interface. These were the SVGAnimationView, TextualAnimationView,
and the VisualAnimationView.

We created a main class named Excellence that took in the expected input, parsed it to understand
what was given, and created a new animation from it. It did this by creating a new builder for the
model and then parsing through the input file to make it comprehendable to the model that we had
previously created. From there, we contructed a view given the type (using a Factory design pattern).
Finally, we called our controller for the animation and gave it the model and view to act as the
designator between the two so that there was no mishandling of information.

We choose to use a controller because we wanted to keep our model as similar to our original as
possible and thought that this would be the easiest way to deal with the different speeds for the
visual animation view.

We also created the Drawing Panel and IDrawingPanel to help draw the shapes for the animation (taken
from Vido's code) and changed to work with our shapes.

We decided to stick with our original design of a hashmap for the commands and their shapes but
added new methods to help fix our issues with sorting and teleportation. We also added initial
lists of commands and shapes because we hadn't done that before, instead creating the hashmap by
passing in the list of commands and shapes from an outside source.
